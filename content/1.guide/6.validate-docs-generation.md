# Validate Docs Generation

> Make sure everything is working as expected before deployment

## GitHub Pages

You can easily verify your documentation generation with the following steps:

::list{type="primary"}
- Create a new file in the `.github/workflows` directory named `validate-docs-generation.yml`. But you can also add it to your existing CI workflow.
- Add the [content below](#workflow-file) to the file.
- Push to main to enable the workflow.
::

From now, each time you create a PR against the main branch, the workflow will be triggered. This ensures that your deployment will never fail in the future.
