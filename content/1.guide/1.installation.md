# Installation

## Prerequisites

Because ArmoniK Docs Theme is based on [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer.

To install Node.js, you can follow the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, verify your installation by running the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
v18.13.0 # or a more recent version. LTS is written on top of the download page.
```

Then, check that `pnpm`, the package manager of Node.js, is installed:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
8.19.3 # or a more recent version. Latest is written on top of the download page.
```

::alert{type="warning"}
On Linux, the default version of Node.js is too old. You need to install a newer version of Node.js.

Read more about [update process on Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version).

## Create a new project

To be able to use ArmoniK Docs Theme, you need to create a new Docus project.

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init <folder-name> -t themes/docus
```

::alert{type="info"}
In the context of a documentation for an ArmoniK repository, we highly recommend to use the name of `.docs` (with a dot) as the folder name.
::

Once done, you can add install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd <folder-name>
pnpm install # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev # Start the development server
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can also use `npm` or `yarn` instead of `pnpm` but we highly recommend to use `pnpm` because it's faster and more efficient.
::

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the default Docus documentation.

But we want to use ArmoniK Docs Theme, so let's do it! :icon{name="noto:rocket"}

## Install ArmoniK Docs Theme

To install ArmoniK Docs Theme, you need to install it as a dev dependency of your project.

```bash
pnpm install -D @aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can find the latest version of ArmoniK Docs Theme on [pnpmjs.com](https://www.pnpmjs.com/package/@aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme).
::

Then, you must add it to the `nuxt.config.ts` file, which is the config file of Nuxt.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: '@aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme',
})
```

By default, the installation will extends from `@nuxt-theme/docus`. And because `ArmoniK Docs Theme`, we can safely remove it from the `nuxt.config.ts` file and from the `package.json` file.

```bash
pnpm uninstall @nuxt-theme/docus
```

Finally, stop the dev server and restart it:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

And _Voil√†_! You should see the ArmoniK Docs Theme in your browser. :icon{name="noto:ok-hand"}

## Update `README.md`

The next step is to update the `README.md` file to add the following content:

```md
# <project name> Docs

Docs for <project name>

## Installation

> Be aware to be in the .docs folder

```bash
pnpm install
```

> If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it with the following command: `npm install -g pnpm`

## Usage

To run the docs locally, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To build the docs, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run generate
```

For more information, check out the [armonik-docs-theme documentation](https://aneoconsulting.github.io/armonik-docs-theme).

## Update `app.config.ts`

The last step is to update the `app.config.ts` file to add the following content:

```ts
export default defineAppConfig({
  docus: {
    title: '<project name>',
    description: '<description>',
    titleTemplate: '%s - <project name>',
    socials: {
      github: 'aneoconsulting/<project name>',
    },
    github: {
      dir: '.docs/content',
      repo: '<project name>',
      owner: 'aneoconsulting',
    },
  }
})
```

::alert{type="info"}
Don't forget to replace `<project name>` and `<description>` by the name and the description of your project and you can find more information about the `app.config.ts` file on the [Docus documentation](https://docus.dev/introduction/configuration).
