# Installation


## Prerequisites

Because ArmoniK Docs Theme is based on [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer.

To install Node.js, you can follow the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, verify your installation by running the following command:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
v18.13.0 # or a more recent version. LTS is written on top of the download page.
```

Then, check that `npm`, the package manager of Node.js, is installed:

```bash
npm --version
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
8.19.3 # or a more recent version. Latest is written on top of the download page.
```

::alert{type="warning"}
On Linux, the default version of Node.js is too old. You need to install a newer version of Node.js.

Read more about [update process on Linux](https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version).
::

## Create a new project

To be able to use ArmoniK Docs Theme, you need to create a new Docus project.

```bash	
npx nuxi@latest init <folder-name> -t themes/docus
```

::alert{type="info"}
In the context of a documentation for an ArmoniK repository, we highly recommend to use the name of `.docs` (with a dot) as the folder name.
::

Once done, you can add install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
cd <folder-name>
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run dev # Start the development server
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see the default Docus documentation.

But we want to use ArmoniK Docs Theme, so let's do it! :icon{name="noto:rocket"}

## Install ArmoniK Docs Theme

To install ArmoniK Docs Theme, you need to install it as a dev dependency of your project.

```bash
npm install -D @aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme
```

Then, you must add it to the `nuxt.config.ts` file, which is the config file of Nuxt.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: "@aneoconsutling/armonik-docs-theme",
});
```

By default, the installation will extends from `@nuxt-theme/docus`. And because `ArmoniK Docs Theme`, we can safely remove it from the `nuxt.config.ts` file and from the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm uninstall @nuxt-theme/docus
```

Finally, stop the dev server and restart it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And _Voil√†_! You should see the ArmoniK Docs Theme in your browser. :icon{name="noto:ok-hand"}
