# Get started

This documentation will guide you through the usage of ArmoniK Docs Theme from installation to deployment and customization.

::alert{type="warning"}
This documentation assume that you're familiar with [ArmoniK](https://armonik.fr) and [Markdown](https://markdownguide.com).
::

## A lot of docs

ArmoniK is an **open-source project** composed by more that **10 repositories** but each of them needs a documentation. In the same time, developers deserve a tool to **ease the process of writing documentation** because there is a lot to write.

To achieve this goal, developers needed:

::list{type="primary"}
- Ready to use documentation
- Markdown support
- Easy to customize
- Live preview of changes
- Easy to deploy
::


## A theme to unified

The first step was to find a way to **unified all the documentation** and the **developer experience** across **all the repositories**.

The solution was to create a theme that can be used **across every documentation** but **maintain in a single repository**. To achieve this goal, we decided to use [Docus](https://docus.dev) as a base for the theme.

::callout{type="primary"}
#summary
What is Docus?
#content
[Docus](https://docus.dev) is a **pre-configured theme documentation** to write pages in Markdown. It use an extended Markdown syntax call [MDC](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/mdc/) to add components to Markdown.
::

This theme, called **ArmoniK Docs Theme**, is a layer on top of Docus to add features, components and customization specific to ArmoniK.

::callout{type="primary"}
#summary
What's underneath ArmoniK Docs Theme?
#content
ArmoniK Docs Theme is a layer on top of [Docus](https://docus.dev).

Docus is a content tool build by the Nuxt Team and based on [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org).

It's important to remember that **it's not a fork but a layer** on top of Docus. This means that every new feature or customization done in Docus will be available in ArmoniK Docs Theme. This is the same for every other documentation based on this theme. Every new feature or customization will be available in every documentation based on this theme.

**This is the power** of this theme and this allow us to **maintain only one theme** for all the documentation and to have a **unified developer experience**.
