# Update

The theme is updated regularly to fix bugs and add new features. You can update it manually or automatically.

## Manual Update

To update the theme, you need to update the `@aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme` dependency in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme": "^0.0.0"
  }
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
Find latest version on GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/armonik-docs-theme/releases) or on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aneoconsultingfr/armonik-docs-theme).
::

You can do it manually or with the following command:

```bash
npx taze
```

Then, you can follow the prompt.

## Automatic Update

To enable automatic update, you can use [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) or [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/).

In ArmoniK, we use Renovate. Here's our configuration for a repo with a `.docs` folder:

```json [renovate.json]
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "config:base",
    "group:allNonMajor",
    ":semanticCommitTypeAll(chore)",
    "helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests"
  ],
  "rangeStrategy": "bump",
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "groupName": "docs npm packages",
      "groupSlug": "docs-npm",
      "matchPaths": [
        ".docs/**"
      ],
      "matchDatasources": [
        "npm"
      ]
    },
    {
      "groupName": "github actions",
      "groupSlug": "github-actions",
      "matchDatasources": [
        "github-tags"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

We group all non-major updates in a single PR and we use semantic commit type `chore` for all commits.

We pin GitHub Actions digests to avoid breaking changes or security issues in our workflows.

We group npm packages found in the documentation and GitHub Actions in two different PRs to avoid conflicts.

::alert{type="info"}
Grouping npm packages from documentation in a single PR is used to avoid grouping npm packages from the project in the same PR.
