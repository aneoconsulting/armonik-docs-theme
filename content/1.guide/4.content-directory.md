# Content Directory

Now, you know how to write documentation in Markdown and how to use MDC to add components to your documentation. But **how to organize your documentation**?

The answer is the `content` directory. It's the directory where you will store all your documentation. It's the heart of your documentation.

## Structure

There is not a specific structure to follow. You can **organize** your documentation **as you want**. Here is an example of a documentation structure:

```txt
content/
├── 0.index.md
├── 1.guide/
│   ├── 1.getting-started.md
│   ├── 2.configuration.md
│   ├── 3.writing.md
│   └── 4.content-directory.md
└── 2.api/
    ├── 1.components.md
    └── 2.directives.md
```

But there is some interesting things to know about the `content` directory.

Docus use the path and the name file to generate the path of the file.

| File | Path |
| --- | --- |
| content/index.md | / |
| content/about.md | /about |
| content/blog/index.md	| /blog |
| content/blog/hello.md |	/blog/hello |
| content/1.guide/2.installation |	/guide/installation |

As you can see, files are prefixed with a number. This is to ensure the order of the files.
